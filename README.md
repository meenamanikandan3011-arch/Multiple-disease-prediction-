🩺 Multiple Disease Prediction System
🔍 Overview
A machine learning–based healthcare application that predicts the risk of Parkinson’s Disease, Kidney Disease, and Liver Disease using patient medical data. The system helps in early disease detection by providing fast and accurate predictions through an interactive Streamlit web app.

⚙️ Solution
Built separate ML models for each disease
Applied data preprocessing (imputation, encoding, scaling)
Integrated all models into a single Streamlit dashboard
Displayed predictions with probability and risk level

🧠 Machine Learning
Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
Models saved using Pickle for deployment

🛠 Tech Stack
Python,Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit.
